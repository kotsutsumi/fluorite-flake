# Post Task Actions
- Run `pnpm lint`, `pnpm check`, and `pnpm build` before submitting changes to ensure code quality and build integrity.
- If CLI behavior changes, capture sample terminal output in the PR description for reviewers.
- Keep documentation (README, AGENTS.md) aligned with new commands or flags introduced.
