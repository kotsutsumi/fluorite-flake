# CLI Reference

`fluorite-flake` is a single entrypoint that scaffolds all supported templates. Use the command below to start a new project:

```bash
pnpm dlx fluorite-flake create <project-name> [options]
```

If you omit options, the CLI prompts you to choose a template, optional services, and additional setup tasks.

## Common Flags

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--template <name>` | Bypass prompts and select a template such as `nextjs`, `expo`, or `tauri`. |
| `--no-install` | Skip dependency installation. Useful in CI where you only need generated sources. |
| `--git` | Initialize a Git repository and create the first commit automatically. |
| `--debug` | Enable detailed logs for diagnostics. |

## Internationalization

Force the CLI locale with `FLUORITE_LOCALE=ja` or `FLUORITE_LOCALE=en`. If unset, the CLI detects the OS locale and falls back to English.

```bash
FLUORITE_LOCALE=ja pnpm dlx fluorite-flake create sample
```

## Template Maintenance

Update templates under `templates/` and run `pnpm build` to refresh distribution artifacts. Review tests in `test/e2e` for end-to-end coverage and update them whenever template behavior changes.
