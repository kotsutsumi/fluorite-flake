# Quickstart

This section walks you through installing the CLI, generating a project, and verifying the development workflow.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or newer
- pnpm 8 or newer (use `corepack enable` to pin the pnpm version)

Verify your environment:

```bash
node --version
pnpm --version
```

## Install and Scaffold

Run the CLI through `pnpm dlx` so you always execute the latest release without a global install.

```bash
pnpm dlx fluorite-flake create my-app
```

Follow the interactive prompts to pick a template, package manager, and optional integrations. The CLI validates your selections and reports any missing prerequisites.

## Explore the Generated Project

After creation, review the template README and start the dev server. For a Next.js project, run:

```bash
cd my-app
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

To enable verbose logging during scaffolding, set `FLUORITE_DEBUG=true`:

```bash
FLUORITE_DEBUG=true pnpm dlx fluorite-flake create sample
```

## Next Steps

- See **CLI Reference** for every flag and prompt
- Inspect template sources under `templates/` inside this repo
- When adding a private template, extend the logic in `src/commands/create` and add coverage in `test/`
